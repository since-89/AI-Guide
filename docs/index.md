The J1/J2 Survival Guide 🛬✨

So… you’re packing your bags and moving to the U.S. on a J1 (or tagging along as a J2)?
Congrats! 🎉 That’s huge. But let’s be honest — figuring out life here is not as simple as hopping off the plane and grabbing a burger.

You’ll need to deal with things like:

mysterious forms with names like I-94 and DS-2019 (yes, they sound like droids from Star Wars),

proving you exist to the U.S. government (SSN, EAD),

getting around (driver’s license, buses, or begging friends for rides),

and the fun stuff like finding groceries that taste like home.

This guide is basically a survival manual written by people who’ve already been through the “Wait, what’s an EAD?!” panic.

What’s inside

📑 Visas & Paperwork – SSN, EAD, health insurance, the alphabet soup

🚗 Life Setup – bank accounts, housing, driver’s license, phone plans

🍲 Food & Living – groceries, must-have kitchen hacks, where to find masala

👨‍👩‍👧 For Dependents – work options for spouses, schooling for kids, how not to get bored

🤦 Common Oopsies – mistakes we made so you don’t have to
