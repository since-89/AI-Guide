# EAD (Employment Authorization) — Getting Started

!!! note "Who this is for"
    This page is a general checklist for common EAD scenarios (e.g., **I-765**). Your exact category may differ.

## Checklist
- Decide **which EAD category** applies to you.
- Create a folder for **supporting documents** (passport, I-94, photos, etc.).
- Fill **Form I-765** (online or paper).
- Pay the **fee** (if applicable).
- Track your case and set reminders for **renewal**.

## Documents you’ll likely need
- Passport bio page (scan)
- I-94 record
- I-797 (if applicable)
- 2x2 photos (per USCIS specs)
- Address in the U.S. where you can reliably receive mail

## Tips
- Use a **consistent U.S. mailing address** that won’t change soon.
- Take photos that meet **USCIS requirements**; many photo shops do immigration photos.
- If filing online, save **PDF copies** of everything you submit.
