## About

I am a Ph.D.-trained Operations Research professional with industry and research experience in building
optimization-driven decision systems for real-world supply chain and logistics operations.

My work focuses on translating mathematical models (LP/MILP, decomposition, routing, scheduling)
into production tools that improve cost, utilization, and planning efficiency.

---

## Research / Industry Interests

- Large-scale optimization (LP/MILP) and decomposition methods
- Supply chain network design and resilience
- Scheduling and resource allocation (workforce, terminal ops)
- Transportation, routing, and assignment optimization
- Decision support systems: modeling → engineering → deployment

---

## Experience (selected)

### DP World — Senior Operations Research Specialist
- Workforce assignment optimization (MILP) with measurable utilization gains
- Automated vessel planning toolkit and data pipelines for planners

### Jio Platforms — Lead Data Scientist (Operations Research)
- Assortment planning, routing, and network optimization for retail/logistics
- Patented scheduling optimization work (rail rake allocation)
- vehicle routing for retail products (google api, genetic algorithms, business constraints)
