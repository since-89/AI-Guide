> **Disclaimer:** This is my personal, non-legal experience applying for an EAD using **Form I-765**. Immigration rules and fees change. Always verify on official USCIS pages before you submit.

## TL;DR
- **What**: EAD = Employment Authorization Document via **Form I-765**.  
- **Who**: Depends on your **eligibility category** (e.g., F-1 OPT/CPT `(c)(3)`, H-4 spouses `(c)(26)`, AOS `(c)(9)`, TPS, refugees/asylees). See official instructions.  
- **Where**: Best to **file online** with a free **USCIS account** (faster updates).  
- **How long**: Timelines vary by category/workload; plan for a few months. Check live processing times.  
- **Renewals**: Many categories have automatic work-authorization extensions after timely filing—check if you qualify.

## What is an EAD (and do you need one)?
If your current US status **doesn’t** already grant unrestricted work authorization, you typically need an **EAD** to work legally. USCIS processes this via **Form I-765**. Confirm your **eligibility category** in the official **I-765 Instructions**.

- USCIS I-765 page (file online / account): https://www.uscis.gov/i-765  
- I-765 Instructions (PDF): https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/forms/i-765instr.pdf

---

## Documents I Prepared (Checklist)
- **Passport** (ID page + US visa page)  
- **I-94** (from CBP) — https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/  
- **Prior EAD** (if any)  
- **Status evidence** (e.g., I-20 for OPT, I-797 approvals, marriage cert for H-4, I-485 receipt for AOS)  
- **Two recent US-spec passport photos** (digital for online filing)  
- **US mailing address** (stable)  
- **Payment method** (US card/bank for USCIS portal)

> **Pro tip:** Name files clearly (`01-Passport.pdf`, `02-I94.pdf`, …). Keep sizes small but readable.

## Filing: Online vs Paper
**Online (recommended):**
1. Create a **USCIS account** and choose **Form I-765**.  
2. Answer on-screen questions, **upload evidence**, pay fee, and **submit**.  
3. Your **receipt (I-797C)** will be available to download; status updates arrive in your account/email.

**Paper (optional):** If you must file by mail, use the latest **I-765 Instructions** for the correct address and requirements.

## Tracking & Timelines
- **Processing times tool** (choose your form/category): https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/  
- Expect several weeks to a few months depending on category and workload.  
- **Premium Processing** exists for some categories (e.g., F-1 OPT/STEM). Check current USCIS guidance.

---

## After Approval: Receiving Your Card
Once approved, USCIS produces and mails the EAD card (often via USPS). Track updates from your online account and USPS as applicable.

---

## Starting Work: I-9 & SSN
- **I-9:** Your employer will verify work authorization using your **EAD card**.  
- **SSN:** If you didn’t request an SSN within the I-765, you can apply separately via the Social Security Administration after approval.

---

## Renewals & Avoiding Gaps
- **File early** before your current EAD expires.  
- If eligible and you file a **timely renewal**, you may receive an **automatic extension** of work authorization—carry your **I-797C** receipt with your expired EAD for I-9. Verify the latest rules on USCIS.

---

## Address & Moving Tips
- Use a **stable US mailing address** if you might move soon.  
- If you change address after filing, **update USCIS** via your account.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Choosing the **wrong eligibility category** (always confirm in the I-765 instructions).  
- Uploading **unclear** scans/photos.  
- Using **outdated fees**—always check the **USCIS fees page** the day you file.
